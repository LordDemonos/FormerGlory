Vex Thal is the final raid zone in Shadows of Luclin expansion. There is a ton of trash. There is even trash that spawns more trash! Mobs here have a lot of HP. Generally you need to kill the bosses in order or you’ll face Warders that will Death Touch and/or boot you to the zone in. The Warders are scattered throughout the zone and despawn as bosses are killed.
