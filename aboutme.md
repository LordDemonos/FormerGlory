# Former Glory Guild Charter

## Welcome to Former Glory!

Our guild was founded by a group of former strangers who met in Blackburrow on Project Quarm. We offer a relaxed atmosphere with non-hardcore, non-mandatory raiding. Our goal is not to be the server's first, but to foster a guild of friends across all walks of life to conquer Norrath over the coming years.

If you aren't here to support your fellow guildie in a positive manner and mindset then this is not the guild for you. 

## Guild Member Expectations:

- Treat guildies and fellow Norrathians with respect
- To both give and receive help as an active member
- Support fellow guildies with a positive mindset
- Life > pixels. No mandatory raid attendance.
- On raids, come prepared to listen to the raid officers and be willing to learn the raid encounters.
- To follow any rules put forth by the server admins of Project Quarm: [Link to Project Quarm Rules](https://discord.com/channels/1133452007412334643/1135970415852924958)


## Guild Leadership Expectations:

- A focus on Epic Weapons during Kunark expansion
- Scheduled raids on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday at 9pm EST
- Unscheduled raids will be done with notifications in Discord and /guild chat
- Willingness to help raiders learn
- Zero tolerance for toxic players and toxic play
- Officers will be available to open instances for guild members seeking off-target raids with the understanding that officers, too, have their own lives and schedules.
- To listen to feedback from members and improve rules/policies for the overall benefit of the guild.
- To follow all Guild Member Expectations as well.

	
## Feedback Method

Officer Meetings are held on the first Sunday of every month where feedback, in addition to other items, will be discussed.

We value your input to help us grow and improve so please direct any feedback, criticism, ideas, and issues to an officer to be discussed at one of these meetings.

Thank you for joining us on this epic adventure to reclaim our Former Glory in Norrath! Happy Hunting!
