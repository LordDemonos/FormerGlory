Our guild was founded by a group of former strangers who met in Blackburrow on Project Quarm. We offer a relaxed atmosphere with non-hardcore, non-mandatory raiding. Our goal is not to be the server's first, but to foster a guild of friends across all walks of life to conquer Norrath over the coming years.
