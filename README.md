## About Former Glory

**Former Glory** is a relaxed, non-hardcore guild dedicated to fostering friendships and adventures among players. We believe in creating a welcoming environment where everyone can enjoy the game at their own pace. Our guild was founded by a group of friends who met in Blackburrow, and we aim to maintain that spirit of camaraderie as we explore the vast world of EverQuest together.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide a supportive and enjoyable gaming experience for all members. We focus on:

- **Respect**: Treating all guild members and fellow players with kindness and understanding.
- **Inclusivity**: Welcoming players of all skill levels and backgrounds.
- **Community**: Building lasting friendships through shared experiences in-game.

## Guild Features

- **Non-Mandatory Raiding**: We offer scheduled raids without the pressure of mandatory attendance. Life comes first!

- **Scheduled Events**: Regular raids are held on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 9 PM EST, along with occasional unscheduled events.
