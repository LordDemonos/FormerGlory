If the guild leadership has to step up to lead these, it should be prioritized by what will make the guild stronger as a whole.

If more members want to run these and just have an officer sitting outside, then I dont care what they hit, where or when. As long as I'm not leading/moderating it just putting loot on opendkp.
The challenge is everyone wants but not many are willing to make it happen. This is why we've had one new officer in the past 6 months or so.
So if more pressure is on the guild leadership, it needs a little control otherwise its just day after day of "what about X target I want?" This isnt a menu
Vamcill / Vamistill — 1/9/2026 5:03 PM
I know you think you should cater to what the guild wants to do, but I think of how this guild was formed and the goals it had then. The leadership and officers should try and uphold the guild philosophy, which is a casual raiding guild. If people are mad we dont raid 5hours a day they should find a different guild IMHO. Our decisions to run off night raids every time and extend the raid times does affect the people in the guild. Not everyone can just say no.
Cukazi/Barakkas — 1/9/2026 6:24 PM
If people want to raid and we open the instance for them why should we worry if its 5 hr or 10hr or whatever the number is, once we have a set schedule then people will settle down wanting to hit targets we arent hitting.  Even in the last month of velious people were hitting VP (which is crazy to me) but i liked people were running it
Vamcill / Vamistill — 1/9/2026 8:14 PM
Yes if other people are running it.
I am honestly just more worried about Xanax becoming burnt out then I am about how other people interact with the game. I have been here from the start and I  see the difference in how the guild opperates comparing then to now. I dont say this is a bad thing, just know that we are becoming more hardcore, but I guess maybe all the guilds are because of how the content is.
Vamcill / Vamistill — 1/9/2026 10:55 PM
I dont say it enough. Everyone, especially Xanax are doing a great job. The reason I am vocal in this chat is it should be a safe space for us to bring up how we feel or how we think the members want the guild to be run. I personly feel like I am a voice of the less hardcore players as I dont get on as much as most of you.I mold my opinions not on how I want it done, but how I think the more casual players do. I can disagree and still respect your opinion and decision.

@Dihat I think I mentioned that I can give that bane money back any time. I'll bug you about it next time I see you on
Dihat — 1/10/2026 1:08 PM
Are you totally reimbursed for what you spent and for your time?
Elcleriko/Polgera/Elwario/ — 1/10/2026 1:11 PM
Main Changing to Elwario FYI got to 60 today
Velde / Wool — 1/10/2026 2:12 PM
@Dihat  Yeah, I made back my money and still have 15 sets of steel/temper. If demand dries up from the guild, I am sure I could liquidate those for a ton, but I'm not in any hurry to do that

I have several that were self farmed as well.
Velde / Wool — 1/10/2026 3:35 PM
Rago gave me the extra mats that were gained via guild effort. Probably enough shissar blood for 10-15 weapons, meteor dust for 5-7, and not enough fungoid sap for any. But it's a nice stockpile if we decide to give any out for any reason.

@Xanax/Xanathema/Xanamaniac/Xanti  I have transferred all of dihats spells to the banker alts. If you have any spells to transfer let me know 
Dihat — 1/11/2026 12:02 PM
I’m I had a pretty good system last night for mallets. I bound by lynuga, then turned in. Once I got a mallet I ported to dsp and evacced, handed it and an axe off, and gated. Axes are good at recovering some cost, but being lore is a PITA. I was in a hurry so that’s that.
Tag, sneakyn, vro, Langley, myself, and ummm someone else got em.
Meetchi or sae, I am work, can’t remember

I had a long conversation with Blastman. He did not dispute the DKP deduction, he admits his mistake. We discussed some of the reasons why people have a negative impression of him. He has a medical condition that takes him out of the game from time to time. Some of his issues like dying a lot or the time he ported his group out, those were when he was a returning player and he feels he's improved since then. But for the other things like not being present for fights or not being prepared, he admits he can improve and communicate those breaks more. He wants to be a team player and improve his performance at raids. Overall I think it was a positive interaction.
Dihat — 1/11/2026 12:09 PM
Excellent. I am glad to hear, err read that. When I discussed the port thing with him he shared he was going through some RL shit and felt he was being attacked. I assured him at the time that every porter has done that, but there are steps to do to eliminate the chances. He was very receptive to that at the time as well, and we be cool.
The port thing being months ago

So I’ve given it some thought, and I’ve decided I’m just going to mute Sae going forward. I don’t need his toxic attitude in my life and I want to enjoy our raids like I did before he joined.
Dihat — 1/12/2026 3:04 PM
Out of curiosity. Sae left the raid abruptly last night or I missed him saying he was leaving the raid. It was an off night thing so I didn’t ask questions. Did I miss something?
Velde / Wool — 1/12/2026 3:25 PM
I wasn't there yesterday, and haven't heard any specific incidents, but I do know that Synth is not the first one to make this decision.

 — 1/12/2026 4:51 PM
He just changed his mind and didn't want to go anymore. Moving the cleric out of his group had something to do with it, but I didnt get the impression it was out of anger or done maliciously.
Xanax/Xanathema/Xanamaniac/Xanti

 — 1/12/2026 5:01 PM
And I'm sorry you feel the need to mute Sae. There's a lot of people that wear on me for different reasons around here, but I try not to go that far. 

We are often willing to reorganize our entire schedule to accommodate the person with the least time to play, but we are not willing to have a 10-minute direct conversation with the person whose opinion we dislike. We show empathy for people’s availability but not for their perspective. That gap is what feels wrong.
Dihat — 1/12/2026 5:43 PM
Sae has no filter. His name has come up a few times over the past year or so. The legendary kuuronni incident of 2024 for example. I don’t want to see rifts forming either without people at least trying to talk it out. I am a pretty easy going guy so a lot of stuff just is in one ear and out the other. 

I am not sure of what specifically he has said that is a problem for you @Synth  or if it is more general. I know one person in RL who everything he says regardless of what is said, is like nails on the chalkboard. Is there examples any one of you can share with us?

That said:
1) being helpful is not a free pass to be an asshole
2) people are not always aware they are coming off as an asshole
3) some people are just assholes
4) what you consider to be an asshole is not necessarily what everyone else considers an asshole to be.

He's: abrasive, rude, condescending, selfish, and dismissive. If ya'll don't see it, and it doesn't bother you, I'm glad, because I cannot stand it. Not for one more second.

If you want an example from just the other night, I hopped into a channel with Xanax and crew, talked about what we were planning for the Sunday Raid static and he hits me with one of these:

I think Sae has gotten much better in this expansion. Dosnt bother me as much anymore.

Ya know you can pin a lot of things on Sae. You can pin some of those on a lot of us. But it directly upsets me that you called him selfish, because he's been absolutely generous with his knowledge, his help, and his heart. I've seen him organize key raids even though none of us wanted to. When the guild leaves me in a bad mood, he recognizes that and tries to make things better. This is what a friend does and its not selfish.
Vamcill / Vamistill — 1/12/2026 6:30 PM
@Synth I do agree with Dihat that maybe if you talk about why he pisses you off it might help.
Cukazi/Barakkas — 1/12/2026 6:36 PM
I'm not going to say I am Sae's biggest fan, and there have been many times where is disagreed with him and been frustrated with him.  But i think he is a lot better now then he has ever been in guild, my suggestion is you turn him down to 35% so its easily ignorable but if he has insight you can listen in.
Dihat — 1/12/2026 6:39 PM
I just know that if I am having a conversation with someone and saying that their attitude, behavior, or actions need to corrected, specific examples are more useful. If speaking generally, it is harder to say, you always do this, or you sometimes come off as that.
Synth

 — 1/12/2026 6:39 PM
I'm glad hes been those things for you, and I'm not denying they're true. They're just not true for me. I can possibly consider 35% volume idea though. Not trying to cause drama, just a heads up why I may not respond when he's talking.

We once had a private channel, our own little corner where we could chill and focus. When that was taken away, it reverted back to people joining randomly and having side conversations. This can definitely get annoying from time to time, but I didnt take my group out of this discord because after the server shut down I felt it benefitted the community to show presence. For people to see users in the voice chat doing something actively, it promotes others doing the same. If this is causing any abrasion with the people who join, it may be time to reconsider starting our own private community. I know other statics have done the same, I just didnt think it was a good idea.
I'd love to go back in time a couple years though and recall the things people said about Fabio, over and over again month after month.
Cukazi/Barakkas — 1/12/2026 6:47 PM
I love Fabio
Dihat — 1/12/2026 6:47 PM
Hell my wife who doesn’t play wants me to turn Fabio down.
Synth

 — 1/12/2026 6:49 PM
Love Fabio, xped with him a bunch, done random shit with him, helped other random people with him in the middle of the night. Never once has Fabio made me feel stupid, small, or excluded the way Sea does on a consistent basis. 
Dihat — 1/12/2026 6:55 PM
Reminds me of Adam savage and Jaime Heineman from mythbusters. Off camera they did not like each other. Disagreed on a lot of things. They weren’t friends. However they worked well together and made an awesome show. I am not sure if there is a moral of the story there or not.
Cukazi/Barakkas — 1/12/2026 7:47 PM
But I will say this about Sae, he helps out a lot people in the guild.
Elcleriko/Polgera/Elwario/ — 1/14/2026 6:11 PM
So what are thoughts on if we kill boss's tonight it will mess up new raid schedule for VT being on Monday and Friday?
Cukazi/Barakkas — 1/14/2026 6:13 PM
I don't think so, just kinda leave off where we were tongiht and can coth up next friday for the bosses we leave up monday to try and kill aten ra on friday
And Monday and Friday we can practice cothing just fine without the added risk it will leave today if we do it today.  We will still have to kill the trash behind the blob after we kill it anyways
Elcleriko/Polgera/Elwario/ — 1/14/2026 6:25 PM
True just means we skip boss's we kill today on monday then following monday will be up to start the schedule
So the important key is Palace right which is rock guy right do not need to do north south wing at this time?
Dihat — 1/14/2026 6:56 PM
Right. Key guy is near the entrance
Cukazi/Barakkas — Yesterday at 8:09 PM
I will be missing raid tomorrow night, i gotta baby sit adults at work since my evening shift people don't do shit. Sad that you changed the raid schedule but i get why
