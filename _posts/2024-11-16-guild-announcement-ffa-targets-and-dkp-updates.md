## Guild Announcement: Target and DKP Updates

Good Afternoon All! Hope you're having a great Saturday!

We're formally announcing a few more small adjustments today:

### Target Updates

- **FFA Targets**: Naggy, Vox, and Drusella are now FFA (Free-for-All).
- **Target Kill Time Tracking**: When killing any of these targets, please add the Target Kill Time to the Target Tracking Channel.
- **Scheduled Guild Runs**: We will attempt to schedule guild runs for Drusella, Naggy, or Vox. Please respect these scheduled spawn timers.
- **Unscheduled Kills**: If it's not specifically on the schedule and the target is up, feel free to kill it!
- **Kunark Dragons**: These are off our rotation unless specifically needed/requested.

### DKP Changes

- **Off-Night DKP**: We are discontinuing Off-Night DKP.
- **Scheduled Raid Nights**: Now M/W/F/Sat, awarding 75 DKP for attendance.
- **Non-scheduled Events**: 
  - Will be just for fun
  - DKP usage for items will be at the discretion of the event leader
  - Loot rules must be made clear beforehand
  - If loot rules are not specified, DKP rules will apply by default

That's all for now, folks! Love ya and thanks for being here!
