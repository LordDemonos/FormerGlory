# Welcome to Former Glory!

Thank you for choosing to spend your time in Norrath with <Former Glory>. We've recently onboarded many new members and are now slowing down recruitment to refine our group for Velious Day 1. Our goal is to have an elite, geared, and well-coordinated raid force accustomed to working together.

## Upcoming Changes

- Adjustments to our Loot policy starting in November

## Expectations for New Members

1. **Learn your class**
   - Ask other guild members of your class about raid expectations and requirements

2. **Ask questions**
   - Don't guess or assume; ask in /group, /rs, /gu, or /tell an officer or Talamild directly
   - We prefer answering questions to rescuing you from bear pits

3. **Prepare for raiding**
   - Reach level 60
   - Obtain necessary items: Bark Potions, Resist Potions, Resist Gear, etc.
   - If unsure, ask for help

4. **Communication**
   - Always be on Discord during raids
   - Use /afk messages when stepping away, even briefly
   - Set up a tell window to avoid missing important messages in combat text
   - Listening on Discord is mandatory; speaking is optional

**Note:** Unresponsive members may be removed from the guild.

Our aim is to have our raid team fully geared and prepared for all Velious content on launch day. We're excited to have you join us on this journey!

Welcome again to <Former Glory>!
