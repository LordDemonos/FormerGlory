# Raid Restrictions

During the beginning of the expansion, we need to bring our best to raids so we can learn encounters. We ask that all members attend raids on the Raid Main only. The obvious exception is if a Raid Alt can fill a role the raid is missing and needs.

Later in the expansion when raids are easier and on farm, you may ask an officer if you can bring an alt.

Raid Mains and Raid Alts are required to be Level 60 + Run Speed 3 starting January 1st. No characters will be grandfathered in.

# Loot Rules for Luclin (Clarification)
- Raid Mains and Raid Alts are required to be Level 60 + Run Speed 3 starting January 1st. No characters will be grandfathered in.
- This means if you want to bid as a Raid Main or a Raid Alt, the character you're bidding for must be Lv60+Run3. 
- Characters sub Lv60 must bid as Non-Raiding Alt. You are still allowed to bid though!

# Raiding Gear Expectations

Hopefully we're all aware and prepared by now, but if you plan on raiding and earning DKP you'll need your Ring of the Shissar and Shadowed Scepter Frame ready for the Key to Vex Thal. Melee will need Shissar Bane and Seru Bane weapons. Other common expectations are listed below.

- **Resists on Gear:**
    - about 200 Magic Resist unbuffed
    - about 150+ all other resists
- **Consumables:**
    - Resist Potions (available from Shaman)
    - Pumice Stone (available from vendors)
    - Cloudy Potion (available from vendors)
    
# Offnight Raiding

## Velious, Kunark, and Classic Raid Targets

As we move into Luclin, all **Velious** raid targets are now FFA. Feel free to grab a group of people and an officer and kill them as many are on 1-3 day timers. We encourage people to organize their own raids, set their own loot rules at the start, and claim anything that doesn't interfere with a scheduled raid. We also encourage you to communicate with each other and yield a target if another group wants to take a target the following week. There's plenty for us to share. 

If you need a quest item for an epic or something and you can't form a raid yourself, you can request an MQ or assistance in #instance-target-requests. Officers, please record the target kill time after kill under #target-tracking.
## Luclin Raid Targets

Any Luclin target can be killed so long as it does not interfere with a scheduled raid night. All loot MUST be bid on with DKP. We will come up with a good list of FFA targets as soon as we assess them. 

## Scheduled Offnight Raids

The one exception is if an officer schedules an offnight raid, those raid targets become off limits for others to kill. Please respect the guild’s scheduled offnight raids. These targets will typically be:

- Veeshan’s Peak – 6 days and 18 hours
- Trakanon - 2 days 18 hours
- Sleeper’s Tomb - 6 Days 18 Hours
- Dozekar - 2 days 18 hours
- King Tormax - 6 days 18 hours
# Special Item Loot Rules

## Aten Ha Ra Necklace

Bidding on the **Soul Essence of Aten Ha Ra** required for the highly sought after **Talisman of Vah Kerrath** will have the following restrictions:

- One per account/person
- DKP cap for bidding on this will be removed at the end of Luclin on October 1 2026.

## Arx Key

These will go to people with the highest raid attendance to start. We will need them to access Seru. Once we have enough we'll open bidding as normal.

# Guild Bank

Since we have begun farming old content and selling items for guild funds, we've been able to increases our guild bank as follows.

Activist raised about 11k. About 3k was used to fund idols and mallets and he has **8k** remaining. 

Xanax increased their bank from 12k on 11/25 up to **182.6k** as of Jan 1st. 

Dihat has about **90.5k** remaining in his stash.

# Guild Website Update

https://formerglory.lol has been updated with boss guides for all Luclin encounters. I'll have to update things like respawn times, health regen, and CH chain times once we know more. This website is our space, so while I've pulled strats and maps from eqprogression.com, if we learn something we can edit these pages ourselves and inform the rest easily. If there's more information you'd like to make available just let me know.

# Recruitment Post

We'll be making a new recruitment post on the official discord channel. Other guilds remake theirs every week and they aren't supposed to. Instead we're classy and get far more engagement due to all the comments and replies we make. I'd like people to take pictures in our first two weeks of everything we kill so we can make a nice new recruitment post when the time comes. Thanks in advance!

# Server Cap Situation

Many have asked what we'll be doing if a player is unable to log in on raid nights due to the server being full. We will not be awarding DKP if you cannot log in to raid.

# Arx Key Amendment/Clarification

All, it has come to my attention that a few are confused and displeased with the way we handled and communicated the rules around the Arx Key. Let me do my best to explain. I wrote:

_These will go to people with the highest raid attendance to start. We will need them to access Seru. Once we have enough we’ll open bidding as normal._

I'll be honest. This wasn't on my list of topics to discuss in our meeting and when it came up, I didn't understand it well. I was trying to take notes on the previous topic, and didn't get the full picture of what this key was for.

When I discussed this with our leadership team, the idea was to uphold a few key concepts that Talamild had set in place as guild leader.

We do not want to take things for guild logistics if we can help it. The same goes for loot counciling items based on RA. We only want to do this if absolutely necessary and leave the choice up to the players. With the 18hr lockout and book mechanic, the team didn't feel we needed more than 1 guaranteed at raids.
We want everything to have a DKP cost. Its important to the system to get people to spend their DKP, and so I apologize if I ever gave anyone the impression they'd be receiving items for free. This was never stated or the case, I simply wasn't sure how we'd be divvying them out.

**Arx Key items will be put up for auction, as a set of four.**

I understand that this has caused some to think that I may have rigged the system to get loot before someone else. I don't have a great way to convince you that nobody has full power here, and the officers would have thrown my out if they thought I was cheating them. Everyone seems to rolls their eyes when I try to make things right. I'm reminded this is a game where we're overly spoiled with pixels and in a few months we'll be swimming in them. If you think ill of me for mismanaging and not understanding this issue, I'll just have to carry that burden.

# Raid Spell Drops but not the ones you think, no not the Ancient ones either

On the topic of not understanding things. We recently learned that some spells are rarer than others and not part of the same pool. This is something I wish was brought up weeks/months ago. 

A lot of us are kinda excited to explore new content and we haven't been studying the loot tables of every boss. When this topic came up during raid, we were not prepared. We made the call to continue with the rules we had set in place and would review it later. We'll do our best to put these rare spells up for bid, but its going to be difficult to refer to a list of spells and and figure it out on the fly, so we'll need help identifying them when they drop.

## Raiding and Discord Voice Etiquette

But while we're on the subject, changing these rules is not appropriate to discuss during the raid when we're in the middle of doing loot. This has been happening a lot lately. We appreciate suggestions and feedback but during the raid is not the place for this. We need to get a lot better at keeping comms clear during raids and saving these for DMs and discord text chat. There have been an overwhelming number of suggestions and comments lately and it can be pretty distracting when we're trying to keep the raid moving forward. 

Thank you for sticking with us through these expansion growing pains and once again I sincerely apologize for any confusion I may have caused.
