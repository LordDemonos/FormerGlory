# Raid Restrictions

During the beginning of the expansion, we need to bring our best to raids so we can learn encounters. We ask that all members attend raids on the Raid Main only. The obvious exception is if a Raid Alt can fill a role the raid is missing and needs.

Later in the expansion when raids are easier and on farm, you may ask an officer if you can bring an alt.

Raid Mains and Raid Alts are required to be Level 60 + Run Speed 3 starting January 1st. No characters will be grandfathered in.
# Raiding Gear Expectations

Hopefully we're all aware and prepared by now, but if you plan on raiding and earning DKP you'll need your Ring of the Shissar and Shadowed Scepter Frame ready for the Key to Vex Thal. Melee will need Shissar Bane and Seru Bane weapons. Other common expectations are listed below.

- **Resists on Gear:**
    - about 200 Magic Resist unbuffed
    - about 150+ all other resists
- **Consumables:**
    - Resist Potions (available from Shaman)
    - Pumice Stone (available from vendors)
    - Cloudy Potion (available from vendors)
# Offnight Raiding

## Velious, Kunark, and Classic Raid Targets

As we move into Luclin, all **Velious** raid targets are now FFA. Feel free to grab a group of people and an officer and kill them as many are on 1-3 day timers. We encourage people to organize their own raids, set their own loot rules at the start, and claim anything that doesn't interfere with a scheduled raid. We also encourage you to communicate with each other and yield a target if another group wants to take a target the following week. There's plenty for us to share. 

If you need a quest item for an epic or something and you can't form a raid yourself, you can request an MQ or assistance in #instance-target-requests. Officers, please record the target kill time after kill under #target-tracking.
## Luclin Raid Targets

Any Luclin target can be killed so long as it does not interfere with a scheduled raid night. All loot MUST be bid on with DKP. We will come up with a good list of FFA targets as soon as we assess them. 
## Scheduled Offnight Raids

The one exception is if an officer schedules an offnight raid, those raid targets become off limits for others to kill. Please respect the guild’s scheduled offnight raids. These targets will typically be:

- Veeshan’s Peak – 6 days and 18 hours
- Trakanon - 2 days 18 hours
- Sleeper’s Tomb - 6 Days 18 Hours
- Dozekar - 2 days 18 hours
- King Tormax - 6 days 18 hours
# Special Item Loot Rules

## Aten Ha Ra Necklace

Bidding on the **Soul Essence of Aten Ha Ra** required for the highly sought after **Talisman of Vah Kerrath** will have the following restrictions:

- One per account/person
- DKP cap for bidding on this will be removed at the end of Luclin on October 1 2026.
## Arx Key

These will go to people with the highest raid attendance to start. We will need them to access Seru. Once we have enough we'll open bidding as normal.
# Guild Bank

Since we have begun farming old content and selling items for guild funds, we've been able to increases our guild bank as follows.

Activist raised about 11k. About 3k was used to fund idols and mallets and he has **8k** remaining. 

Xanax increased their bank from 12k on 11/25 up to **182.6k** as of Jan 1st. 

Dihat has about **90.5k** remaining in his stash.
# Guild Website Update

https://formerglory.lol has been updated with boss guides for all Luclin encounters. I'll have to update things like respawn times, health regen, and CH chain times once we know more. This website is our space, so while I've pulled strats and maps from eqprogression.com, if we learn something we can edit these pages ourselves and inform the rest easily. If there's more information you'd like to make available just let me know.
# Recruitment Post

We'll be making a new recruitment post on the official discord channel. Other guilds remake theirs every week and they aren't supposed to. Instead we're classy and get far more engagement due to all the comments and replies we make. I'd like people to take pictures in our first two weeks of everything we kill so we can make a nice new recruitment post when the time comes. Thanks in advance!
