## Words

Hey all, just wanted to give a quick update on some changes that came on June 1st we'd like to make everyone aware of.

- ST keys are still going off the Raid Attendance list with the exception of Yelinak and Zlandikar. Yeli and Zlandi keys will go to DKP for all who wish to bid. Wear it or turn it into a key, bid for an alt, go get it!

- Western Wastes dragons (guild instance) are being taken off DKP. Feel free to grab a raid from an officer and go to town on them for 6 necks. 

-  Lodizol loot is also being taken off of DKP. Please try to keep Velious targets in the 6pm EST+ window for availability.

- Cukazi would like to have a word with you all about turning /anon and /roleplay OFF during raids. It makes it easier to get class counts and organize groups.
