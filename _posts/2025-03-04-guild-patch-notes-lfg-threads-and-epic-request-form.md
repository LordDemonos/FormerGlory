**Guild Patch Notes 3/4/25**

Hey Glorious Adventurers!! We made some changes to the work flows of organizing how y’all group up outside of raids and how we can better streamline anc keep track of who needs epic quest stuff from raid encounters. 


## Self Organizing is Cool 
The static LFG channel has changed to a thread based system! This will help keep that channel a little more organized, especially when multiple conversations are happening at once.

If you post in a thread you’ll always be notified when there’s new comment. If no activity occurs in 3-7 days that thread will be “invisible” unless you go look for it manually in the channel, or someone adds to it, 

We heavily encourage this channel to make self organized static exp groups, item farm groups, faction farm sessions, quest step help, quake snipes, etc.. really anything you’d like to gauge interest in content on that isn’t a raid or raid epic fight.

Feel free to delete your posts if you’re done with a one off group or just let the thread expire and archive. 

## Let There Be Epics

We've revamped our epic mob fight request process:

1. **New Request Form**: Use our Google Form to submit raid-force epic target requests: [Epic Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrdGZCRdUpdJ14DtRNTurlymNWYFvUbFBp0GvLOXvZb9JApA/viewform)
    
2. **Centralized Target List**: Check [https://formerglory.lol/targets](https://formerglory.lol/targets) for approved targets
    
    - New entries posted daily at 4 PM and 4 AM EST
        
3. **Channel Changes**:
    
    - The #epic-mob-fight-request channel is now for announcements only
        
4. **Special Requests**: For raid force targets not in the form, please message Xanax directly
    

These changes will help us better organize epic hunts and ensure everyone has a fair chance to participate. If you have any questions about these changes, please don't hesitate to ask a guild officer. Happy hunting!
