**Guild Patch Notes 3/4/25**

Hey Glorious Adventurers! We've made some exciting changes to improve how we organize groups outside of raids and streamline epic quest tracking. Here's what's new:

## Self-Organizing is Cool

The static LFG channel has evolved into a thread-based system! This upgrade will help keep conversations organized, especially when multiple groups are forming simultaneously.

Key features:

- Post in a thread to receive notifications for all new comments
    
- Inactive threads (no activity for 7 days) become "invisible" but can be revived anytime
    
- Encourages self-organized groups for:
    
    - Static exp groups
        
    - Item farming
        
    - Faction grinding
        
    - Quest assistance
        
    - Quake snipes
        
    - Any non-raid content you want to gauge interest in
        

Feel free to delete your posts after one-off groups or let threads naturally archive.

## Let There Be Epics

We've revamped our epic mob fight request process:

1. **New Request Form**: Use our Google Form to submit raid-force epic target requests: [Epic Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrdGZCRdUpdJ14DtRNTurlymNWYFvUbFBp0GvLOXvZb9JApA/viewform)
    
2. **Centralized Target List**: Check [https://formerglory.lol/targets](https://formerglory.lol/targets) for approved targets
    
    - New entries posted daily at 4 PM and 4 AM EST
        
3. **Channel Changes**:
    
    - The #epic-mob-fight-request channel is now for announcements only
        
    - Smaller group targets should be posted in #static-group-signup
        
4. **Special Requests**: For raid force targets not in the form, please message Xanax directly
    

These changes will help us better organize epic hunts and ensure everyone has a fair chance to participate. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work!

Let's make this a glorious adventure for all! If you have any questions about these changes, please don't hesitate to ask a guild officer.

Happy hunting, and may your epics be legendary!
