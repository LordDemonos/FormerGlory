### Time: Sundays 8pm - 10pm EST
*This is not a guild run raid and no DKP will be awarded.*

#### Hard cutoff at 11pm if we run late
Goal is to start earlier and end earlier so people can go to bed before work. We'll do what we can but attendance and numbers will drive how many targets we take out.

#### Requirements
- 2 Hybrid Tanks
- 2 Clerics
- 2 Priest class offheals
- 1 Druid/Wizard for transportation
- Goal is 18+ players

### Even Week Targets
#### Fire Giants
[Crown of King Tranix](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/4504) 25% Droprate for MR

#### ~~Lord Nagafen~~ (Once target is on FFA Status)

#### Plane of Sky: Island Trash
Island 3 for [Spiroc Feathers](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/20782) 7.7% Droprate off Various Mobs for Necromancer Epic

Optional Island 4 for [Swirling Sphere of Color](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/20494) 100% Droprate off Essence Tamers for Ranger Epic (Since the Sphere is no-drop, once we obtain a few extra we will skip Island 4 to save time for rarer drops on 3 and 7. We can return to 4 as needed.)

Island 7 for [Crown of Elemental Mastery](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/20764) 6.6% Droprate off Various Mobs for Mage Epic

### Odd Week Targets
#### ~~Lady Vox~~ (Once target is on FFA Status)

[White Dragon Scale](https://www.pqdi.cc/item/11602) 15% Droprate for Bard and Warrior Epic

### Low Turnout or Early Nights
If we should fail to get enough people we will open the target options to any epic fights that require 6-12 people to kill. The same rule applies to any week where we end early and people are still willing to mobilize to a new target.

### Loot Rules
- All Loot will be /random Raiders before Greed
- All Gems will be delivered to Talamild/Guild Bank
- Excess minor Sky items will go to greed/rot
- Excess Spiroc Feathers, Crown of Elemental Mastery, and Dragon Scales will be sold in EC once Dihat is in possession of 2x each. Earnings will be delivered to Talamild/Guild Bank
