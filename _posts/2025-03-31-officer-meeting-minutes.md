# Officer Meeting Minutes

## Member Questions

- **Will Primal weapons be normal DKP items?** Yes, all primal weapons will be DKP'd
- **Will random dragons be killed in raids or off night stuff?** All WW dragons except the big raid targets will be free for all and available for off night fun. WW dragons will be left available for Tuesday night.
- **How would we like to handle epic targets after this week?** Epics will no longer be built into the raid calendar. If you need a large force for an epic target, use the signup here https://formerglory.lol/targets/, and we will arrange for it.
- **Is raid minimum level for Vel set to 60?** HoT trash/Kael/Off-Night will be 55+, All other Velious targets will be 60 Main or officer approved substitution. This will be noted in each raid's MOTD.
- **Can city leader items be won multiple times, example, king tormax head can be turned in for 3 diff items?** All items that fall into this group like the heads, can be won multiple times.
- **Will we have tank list, and CH list, like we have MA's?** Someone will be designated to create a hotkey and announce each MT list, MA, and Cleric order for CH chains. Someone will also be assigned to call out tank swaps.
- **Will we have only 1 or 2 raid leaders talk during Velious raids to be clear?** Pullers, leaders, and Looters will be given higher priority on voice comms, and will make a hotkey to call out "clear comms". Pullers will also be expected to communicate when a pull is incoming more effectively.
- **Are all the Sleepers tomb key dragon necks going to be for keys or will people be able to bid to use?** All ST key pieces will be assigned to Mains based on raid attendance (RA). It will start with the highest raid attendance in the last 90 days and work its way down. All Mains that have 50% or higher RA in the last 90 days will get keys before Alts will be allowed, at which point they will be decided by loot council.
- **Will raids be longer in Velious?** Generally raids will still target 3 hours per night.
- **What happens with raid armor gems or Spells?** To begin with, Armor Gems and new spells will be put up for DKP bid. At some point as interest drops, that will change, as it did in kunark. Rots will be collected for the Bank.
- **What will happen with the Faction item drops?** These now stackable items that drop during raids such as giant heads, will be collected and then sold to members at a reasonable below market price as stacks of 20. They will be announced on discord for the time being. These will help us to purchase consumables or recharge clickies.

## Other Notes

- **Lodi/Stormfeather:** For the first 2 weeks these targets will be FFA, on weekdays they will be available to open after 6pm Eastern, weekends will be available whenever. They will require a 30 minute announcement on discord and in guild chat before killing.
- Please be aware that some targets will need bark potions and/or full resist gear. We expect our raiders to be prepared for this.
- All Quest Armor drops on off night raids will be put up for DKP bid for at least the first 2 weeks, when it may change (see below).
- We will be meeting again after 2 weeks. These first 2 weeks we will be gathering data for several things. Time it takes to kill a target, time it takes to clear to a target, what the drop rate of items off the targets are. After we are up and running we will rehash our raid scheduling to plan better use of the 3 hours available, identify where preclears are needed, and reevaluate looting decisions.
- We expect to be able to have a large enough raid force to target Sleepers Tomb in 3 months
