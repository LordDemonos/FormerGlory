# Raid Restrictions

During the beginning of the expansion, we need to bring our best to raids so we can learn encounters. We ask that all members attend raids on the Raid Main only. The obvious exception is if a Raid Alt can fill a role the raid is missing and needs.

Later in the expansion when raids are easier and on farm, you may ask an officer if you can bring an alt. 

## Raiding Level Requirements

- **All Raid Mains**
	- Level 60 + Run Speed 3

## Raiding Gear Requirements

### Luclin Raids
- **Resists on Gear:**
  - about 200 Magic Resist unbuffed
  - about 150+ all other resists
  
- **Consumables:**
  - Resist Potions (available from Shaman)
  - Pumice Stone (available from vendors)
  - Cloudy Potion (available from vendors)
  
## Target Availability

### Major Raid Targets
Former Glory kills these in regular rotation – Off limits

  - Luclin Raid mobs

### Offnight Raid Targets
If an officer schedules an offnight raid, those raid targets become off limits for others to kill. Please respect the guild’s scheduled offnight raids. These targets will typically be:

- Trakanon - 2 days 18 hours
- Sleeper's Tomb - 6 Days 18 Hours

### FFA Targets
Go nuts, kill these whenever you want, officers please record the target kill time after kill under #target-tracking. Please post in #instance-target-requests if you need a quest item off any of targets.
