3. Click "Characters" on the left side of the screen
4. Check the box for "Inactive Characters"
5. Find your character name and click it

If you don't see your character in the list, message an officer directly with your username and character name(s) for addition.

## Raid Types and DKP Awards

**Note:** You are responsible for tracking your DKP. Check your DKP and raid history regularly on the website. Escalation tools are available on the site.

## Bidding Rules

- Maximum bid: 1000 DKP for all loot
- Multiple max bids: /random roll between max bidders
- Main character bids: Max 1000 DKP

## Character Flexibility

- DKP is pooled between all your characters
- Bid on items as if you are on your main character
- Reasonable accommodations for no-drop items

## DKP Rules

1. Main/Need Primary Bid: For upgrades or needed items
2. Alt/Greed Bid: For alts or selling in EC
3. Generally, you cannot win the same item twice (some exceptions apply)
4. Items won with DKP are yours to keep, sell, or donate back for 50% DKP return
5. Bid on any usable upgrade, regardless of "maximum utilization"
6. Main changes allowed with officer approval (within reason)
7. Certain items may be claimed by the guild for first drops (e.g., Puppet strings)

## Changes to Bidding Rules (Effective 11/4/2024)

### New Member Classification

- Any new member attending a raid will be added as an **ALT RAIDER** to the roster within 24-48 hours of the raid.
- To gain **MAIN RAIDER** bid priority:
  - Character must be Level 60
  - Only 1 Main Raider allowed per member
- Raid with any qualified character; all DKP pools between linked characters are combined.
- To request a change from ALT to MAIN Raider status, direct message Talamild on Discord.

### Raid Schedule and DKP Awards

**Main Raid Nights**
- Monday, Wednesday & Friday at 9pm Eastern US
- DKP Award: +25 at beginning, middle, and end of raid
- Total potential DKP: +75 for full attendance

**Off Night Raids**
- Generally Saturday nights at 9pm Eastern
- Focus on smaller targets
- DKP Award: +20 at beginning and end of raid
- Total potential DKP: +40 for full attendance

### Bidding Priority and Limits

1. **Main Raiders and Alt Raiders**
   - Equal priority in bids
   - Main Raiders: Can bid up to 1000 DKP
   - Alt Raiders: Maximum bid of 400 DKP

2. **Non-Raiding Alts and Greed/Selling Bids**
   - Equal priority with each other
   - Can bid up to 1000 DKP
   - Lose to minimum bids made by Raiding Characters

**Note**: You must select the character for which the item is being bid, regardless of which character you're raiding with at the time.

### Summary

- Raiders default as Alt
- Level 60 required for Main status or highest level character
- Mains can bid up to 1000 DKP
- Raiding alts can bid up to 400 DKP
- Raiders prioritize loot rights over non-raiding alts and greed bids
- Greed bids up to 1000 DKP if no raiding characters need the item

These changes aim to balance main and alt gearing while maintaining our casual mindset. Feedback is always welcome and should be directed to officers for consideration.
