## Bidding Rules

- Maximum bid: 1000 DKP for all loot
- Multiple max bids: /random roll between max bidders
- Main character bids: Max 1000 DKP
- Alt character bids: Max 400 DKP (effective 11/4/2024)

## Character Flexibility

- With officer approval, you may raid on an alt character
- DKP is pooled between all your characters
- Bid on items as if you are on your main character
- Reasonable accommodations for no-drop items

## DKP Rules

1. Main/Need Primary Bid: For upgrades or needed items
2. Alt/Greed Bid: For alts or selling in EC
3. Generally, you cannot win the same item twice (some exceptions apply)
4. Items won with DKP are yours to keep, sell, or donate back for 50% DKP return
5. Bid on any usable upgrade, regardless of "maximum utilization"
6. Main changes allowed with officer approval (within reason)
7. Certain items may be claimed by the guild for first drops (e.g., Puppet strings)

## Changes to Bidding Rules (Effective 11/4/2024)

- Main and alt bids will be in the same pool
- Main bids max at 1000 DKP
- Alt bids max at 400 DKP

These changes aim to balance main and alt gearing while maintaining our casual mindset. Feedback is always welcome and should be directed to officers for consideration.
