# Former Glory Guild Raiding and DKP System

## Summary

These rules aim to balance main and alt gearing while maintaining our casual mindset. Feedback is always welcome and should be directed to officers for consideration.

## Registration

Please register your raiding characters at [formerglory.opendkp.com](https://formerglory.opendkp.com).

A full tutorial on how to use OpenDKP can be found [here](https://formerglory.lol/2024-11-10-opendkp-tutorial/).

### OpenDKP Basics

1. Register with the site and create a profile
2. After your first raid, your character will appear in the character list
3. Click "Characters" on the left side of the screen
4. Check the box for "Inactive Characters"
5. Find your character name and click it
6. CLAIM your character

If you don't see your character in the list, message an officer directly with your username and character name(s) for addition.

### Standard Raid DKP (M/W/F/Sat @9pm EST)
- On-time arrival: +25 DKP
- Mid-raid attendance check: +25 DKP
- Raid completion: +25 DKP
- DKP is pooled between all your characters once the characters are linked on the OpenDKP site

**Note:** You are responsible for tracking your DKP. Check your DKP and raid history regularly on the website. Escalation tools are available on the site.

## Character Flexibility
- Raid Mains will be prioritized when determining keys/unlocks to raid zones (ex. Sleeper's Tomb)
- Your character must meet the raid level requirement set forth in the raid schedule
- Raid with any qualified character

## Rank Types

|Rank|Min Bid|Max Bid|Requirements|Allowed # of characters at this rank|
|----------|----|----|----|----|
|Raid Main|10|1000|Level 60 or highest level character|1|
|Raid Alt|10|400|Default rank for a character you meet the raid requirements for and earn 1 raid tick on|unlimited|
|Non-Raiding Alt|10|1000|Used for characters you are bidding for who have not reached Raid Alt or Raid Main status|unlimited|
|Greed/EC Tunnel|10|1000|-|-|

- Raid Main changes allowed once per expansion
- Raid Main changes outside of the once per expansion will require officer approval
- To request a change from Raid Alt to Raid Main, direct message Talamild on Discord.

## Bidding Priority
- Raid Main = Raid Alt
- Non-Raiding Alt = Greed/EC tunnel
- Raid Main and Raid Alt > Non-Raiding Alt and Greed/EC tunnel

## Bidding Rules

- Bid on the character the item is for with the appropriate rank selected
- Non-raiding Alt and Greed/EC Tunnel bids will not have a character on the OpenDKP site, so bid as your Raid Main with the appropriate rank selected.
- Minimum Bid/Upbid: 10
- Maximum Bid: 1000 DKP for all loot, 400 DKP for Raid Alts
- Multiple max bids: /random roll between max bidders
- Generally, you cannot win the same item twice (some exceptions apply)
- Certain items may be claimed by the guild for first drops (e.g., Puppet strings)
